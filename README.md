## Abstract
The purpose of this study is to perform topic modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis on customer reviews. The results from various models are evaluated against each other, comparing the accuracy, coherence, and performance in a resource-constrained environment. This study contrasts popular topic modeling and sentiment classification models such as LDA, BERTopic, distil-BERT, alBERTa, and large-language models like GPT-4. The analysis provides insights into what customers are saying about a Lenovo mobile product, using NLP techniques to extract qualitative data from reviews.

## Project Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of different topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques in categorizing customer reviews and determining sentiment. The study compares traditional models like LDA and BERTopic with state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, analyzing over 14,000 product reviews. The goal is to extract meaningful themes and sentiments that provide actionable insights into customer satisfaction.

## Key Findings
- **LDA vs. BERTopic:** LDA was found to generate more coherent and interpretable topics than BERTopic, fitting well within the themes produced by GPT-4.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Transformer-based models (DistilBERT and alBERTa) were used to gauge customer sentiment, with the results compared to those generated by GPT-4.
- **GPT-4 Performance:** GPT-4 produced well-defined themes and effectively segmented sentiments, outperforming the traditional models in interpretability and coherence.
